## 4. Points & Season Standings

### Placement Points

### Scoring Policy

- **Best 5:** Only a player's best 5 results from Jan–Nov count toward their season total.

- **Division Changes:** Points stay within the division where they were earned.

- **Tie-breakers:** 1. Highest single-event points, 2. Most 1st places (then 2nd), 3. Average SOS, 4. On-site playoff or rock-paper-scissors.

## 5. Grand Finals

The top 4 players from each division (Adult and Youth) qualify for the Grand Finals.

- **Eligibility:** Must complete monthly events in that division.

- **Division Lock:** On Nov 30, a player is locked into the division where they earned the most points (higher division breaks ties).

- **Format:** Single-elimination (Semifinals and Finals).

- **Time Control:** 30 min + byo-yomi.

- **Prizes:** Adult/Youth top division champions receive $500+; other divisions receive scaled cash or trophies.

## 6. Conduct & Fair Play

- **AI Policy:** No AI or outside assistance; phones must be silent.

- **Sandbagging:** TD may reassign divisions and void results for mis-reported strength.

- **Rankings:** Players are auto-placed by their AGA rating on the day of check-in. It is the player's responsibility to inform the TD of rank updates not reflected in their rating (e.g., if you improved 2+ ranks in the past few months, or have not played in 5+ years).
